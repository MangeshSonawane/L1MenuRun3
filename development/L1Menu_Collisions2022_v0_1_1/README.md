**Comment:** Baseline menu for Run3 developments. Changed scale set to scales_2021_03_02 (upt scale bug fix), same content as L1Menu_Collisions2018_v2_1_0 and L1Menu_Collisions2020_v0_1_3 [Scale set reference, for grammar version 0.8]

**NOTE:** The default behavior of the script sets the prescales of seeds using NotBptx or Bptx to zero. This is due to problems emulating NotBptx in ZeroBias. If you wish to include the prescale information for these seeds, use the --includeBptx option.
