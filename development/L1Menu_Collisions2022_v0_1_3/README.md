**Comment:** Menu for Run3 adding 3 new Tau seeds, two with overlap removal and one with increased threshold of an existing double tau seed. [Scale set reference, for grammar version 0.10]


**NOTE:** The default behavior of the script sets the prescales of seeds using NotBptx or Bptx to zero. This is due to problems emulating NotBptx in ZeroBias. If you wish to include the prescale information for these seeds, use the --includeBptx option.
