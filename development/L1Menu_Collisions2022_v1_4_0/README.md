**Comment:** 
New version of the menu for Run3: the following TripleMu seeds for the Tau3mu search have been modified by adding the OS requirements:
   - L1_TripleMu_2SQ_1p5SQ_0OQ_Mass_Max12 (bit 82)
   - L1_TripleMu_3SQ_2p5SQ_0OQ_Mass_Max12 (bit 83)
    
 **NOTE**: The seed names have not been changed to be able to use them with the present HLT menu.
