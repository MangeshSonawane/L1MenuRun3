**Comment:** 
Copy of the third version of the L1T menu for the 2024 pp data taking, with updated scales for the addition of the CICADA seeds. 
This menu is meant to be used as starting point for the preparation of the menu to be deployed in the test crate for the CICADA commissioning.
The menu has been created by using the last version of TME `0.16.0`, grammar `0.12.0` and updated `scales_2024_02_14`.
