# PRELIMINARY versions of L1 Menus

This directory collects some preliminary versions of the L1 menu that are not official yet but are useful for testing purposes such as:

* usage in the uGT test crate in P5 (a new firmware version corresponding to an updated L1 menu can be tested before official deployment in P5)

* HLT trigger developments relying on a new menu uploaded in CondDB via X20 procedure
