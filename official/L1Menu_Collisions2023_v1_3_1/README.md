**Comment:** 
New version of the L1T menu for initial 2024 commissioning, based on the last 2023 menu v1_3_0 (never deployed due to the LHC incident). This menu has been created by using the last version of TME `0.15.3`, grammar `0.11` and updated scales to `scales_2023_02_16`.

The only difference w.r.t. the last 2023 menu (`L1Menu_Collisions2023_v1_3_0`), is the following:
