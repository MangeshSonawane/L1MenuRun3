**Comment:** 
L1 menu for the 2023 ppRef runs, with ZDC seeds.
This menu has been created by using the last version of TME `0.15.3`, grammar `0.11` and updated scales to `scales_2023_02_16`.
The menu development for the ppRef run is documented in [CMSLITDPG-1181](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-1181).

**NOTE**: The default behavior of the script sets the prescales of seeds using NotBptx or Bptx to zero. This is due to problems emulating NotBptx in ZeroBias. If you wish to include the prescale information for these seeds, use the --includeBptx option.
